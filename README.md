# Minesweeper Technical Test

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to our Minesweeper coding challenge. 
If you havenâ€™t played Minesweeper before, [go give it a try](https://g.co/kgs/aog99ao))â€”itâ€™s a classic!

## Whatâ€™s this all about?

We want to see how you approach building a Minesweeper game in React. The main goal isnâ€™t to finish the game (seriously, donâ€™t stress about that!). Instead, weâ€™re interested in how you think, collaborate, and solve problemsâ€”especially together with us.

## What are we looking for?

- Pair programming & collaboration: Weâ€™ll be working together, so feel free to ask questions, bounce ideas, and suggest approaches. We value teamwork and communication over a perfect end result.
- Curiosity & initiative: Set your own objectives, explore the codebase, and donâ€™t hesitate to use any tools (including LLMs!) to help you out.
- Adaptability: We might jump in to guide the session or ask you to try something new, just to get to know you better.

## What do you get?

- A React project with some basic components, so you don't need to spend time bootstrapping anything.
- A minimal structure to follow. Please, try to stick to it as much as possible, but donâ€™t be afraid to ask if somethingâ€™s unclear.
- An endpoint that generates Minesweeper maps for you. It looks like this:

```
GET https://tech-test.dynatrace.com/api/minesweeper?width=x&height=y&mines=z

With these query params:
- width -> the width of the board.
- height -> the height of the board.
- mines -> the number of mines inside the board.

Returns: a json with
- width
- height
- mines
- board
```

## Tips
- Use LLMs and any resources you like. We encourage it!
- Focus on writing clean, understandable code and communicating your thought process.
- If you get stuck, talk it throughâ€”weâ€™re here to help.

## Feature ideas
Here are some things you can try to implement:
- The basic gameplay: you click a mine, you lose. You uncover all empty tiles, you win!
- A "start over" button.
- Showing the number of adjacent mines.
- Unit tests? :)
- "Flagging" mines with a right click button.
- Uncovering ALL adjacent empty tiles on click.
- Keeping a count of the number of wins.
- Allow the user to change the settings of the board (width, height, number of mines).

Ready? Letâ€™s build something fun together and see if we click! ðŸš€
